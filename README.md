# Godot gestures

This code is updated implementation of multi-touch tutorial from youtube by user 'gtrgn': 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkC1-Z_2brI

Implements sample gestures.

On Desktop machines touch emulation is turned on. It simulates touch events from mouse.
It only emulates one touch point - seems like it can't emulate more. 

To make scaling and rotating work you have to run it on mobile device with multi touch support.
